	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Denki is a little skinner than most of the other male students in his class, not having much visible muscle mass. He has relatively short blonde hair, with a lightning-shaped streak on the left of his side fringe and yellow eyes. When going to U.A., he wears the offical U.A. unfiorm.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>For his original costume, he wears a plain white shirt, an open black jacket with white lighning pattern and matching trousers with two lines running down the legs. He has a single, square-shaped earphone over his right ear.</p>
		<p>For his Provisional Hero License Exam, he changes his costume to a slightly shorter black jacket with fewer white patterns and a yellow-rimmed lighning across each shoudler. He also wears black trousers with small zig=zags near each cuffs, a white belt and white v-neck shirt. Around his right wrist, he wears a wristband with a circular mechanism from which he can shoot disc-shpaed Pointers which aids him in aiming with his Quirk. Addtionally, he wears a headset with a blue-tinted visor.</p>

		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Denki's Quirk is called Electrification. It allows him to generate electricity and covers his body with it. One drawback to his quirk is that when he emits this energy over a distance, he has little to no control over it.</p>
		<p>Another drawback is that his brain can short-circuit when he exceeds his wattage limit, leaving him in a vulnerable state for 1 hour. Though intense training, he increases the amount of electricity he can handle.</p>
