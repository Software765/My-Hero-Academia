		<p>Yuga Aoyama, also known as the Shining Hero: Can't Stop Twinking, is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Yuga has a silm build with a rather feminine face. He has long blonde hair with a side fringe and bright indigo eyes with notable long eyelashes. When attending U.A., he wears the standard male U.A. uniform.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>His hero costume consists of a bluish-black bodysuit, over a suit of metallic lavender and golden amour, whhich includes a chest plate, two spherical shoulder pads, elboow-length vambraces and knee-length boots. He also wears a long, glittery indigo cape, a belt with a golden ring-shaped buckle with a blue crystal, matching smaller ones on his shoulder pads, baggy trousers, boots and a red-tinted wing-shaped visor.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Yuga's Quirk is called Navel Laser. It allows him to shoot a powerful sparkling laser cannon from his navel.</p>
		<p>A drawback to his Quirk is that if he fires the laser for more than one second at a time, he suffers intestinal distress. Through intense training, he reduces this effect.</p>  
		<p>In addition, due to a birth defect, he has very little control over his Quirk and needs a special belt to compensate.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Yuga was born in France and lived with his mother and father. He appears to have a vain and prideful personality, thinking himself as superior to the rest of his classmates. However, this is a facade as he holds severe insecurities about his Quirk. He does also have a compassionate side to him.</p>
		<p>He loves himself most of all.</p>
