		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>Her hero costume is very similar to a traditional dominatrix. It consists of a black leather breastless leotard, that possesses red gemstone-like accessories in a vertical pattern from the collar to the midriff, over a white bodysuit. She also wears translucent black thigh-high stockings that connects to her red utility belt, black knee-boots and a small, red mask outlining her eyes. In addition, she has handcuffs on each wrist and is often seen carrying a flogger-style whip.</p>

		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Nemuri's Quirk is called Somnambulist. It allows her to put nearby people to sleep by exuding a sleep-inducting aroma from her body.</p>
		<p>One drawback is that her Quirk seems to work better on males than females.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Nemuri was born in the Saitama Prefecture. She has a bery playful and flirtatious personality, as she is not afraid to dress or act sexually in front of people. Also, it was because of her first hero costume that regulations on limiting the amount of skin that can be shown in female costume was put in place.</p>
