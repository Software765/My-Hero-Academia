	<div class="info">
		<p>Izuku Midoriya, also known as Deku, is the main protagonist in the My Hero Academia anime. He goes to U.A. High School, where he is a student at Class 1-A.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Izuku is quite short for his age, being below the average height. He has short, messy dark-green hair, big green eyes and small freckles on each cheek.</p>  
		<p>After the Sports Festival, his right hand becomes slightly deformed and has a couple of scars. After his fight with Muscular, his right arm becomes more scared, resulting in him wearing a black compressive sleeve on his upper right arm to support the heavy damage on it.</p> 
		<p>When entering U.A., Izuku wears the standard male U.A. uniform, though his tie is not done properly and along with that, he wears red, ankle boots.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>Originally, his hero costume consisted of a green jumpsuit with a red belt, black elbow pads and knee pads, and white gloves, along with his signature boots. He also wore a mask with long ear-like protrusions and a respirator with a makeshift smile that resembled his favourite hero All Might. This costume got extremely damaged from his fight with Kastuki Bakugo.</p>
		<p>After that, his costume change slightly to be more sturdier and combat-ready. The knee pads have extended to his legs and thighs, and his gloves are tinted beige in colour, along with blue strips. His respirator is now metal and diamond-shaped with eight holes. While he still has his mask, he doesn't wear it as much than before.</p>
		<p>For the Provisional Hero License Exam, he upgrages his costume again to suit his new fighting moves, Shoot Style. He adds iron soles to his red boots and arm braces.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Izuku's Quirk is called One for All. It is an unique quirk that has been passed down for generations. It allows him to stockpile massive amount of power, enhancing their physical abilities. He was Quirkless before catching the attention of All Might, who gives him this Quirk making him the ninth holder of One for All.</p>
		<p>The drawback of his Quirk is that he can't control his quirk at 100%, which causes his limps to break when at use. Through intense training, he is able to control 8% of his quirk. He can even control 20% for a short period of time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Izuku was born near the Shizuoka Prefecture, and lived with his mother, Inko Midoriya. He has a father, Hisashi Midoriya, but he rarely mentions or sees him.</p>
		<p>He has a timid, reserved and even insecure personality due to the bullying he had sustained for his quirklessness and wanting to be a hero. Once he enters U.A., he slowly becomes more confident and brave, eager to prove his worth as a hero. He is inspired by All Might, wanting to be the kind of hero that can protect and save others with a smile.</p>
		<p>He loves to eat Katsudon.</p>
