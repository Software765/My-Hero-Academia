		<p>Tsuyu Asui, also known as The Rainy Season Hero: Froppy, is a student in Class 1-A at UA High School. She has a straightforward and aloof personailty, who always speaks bluntly from her mind and what she thinks about others. When it comes to hero-work, she has shown to be calm and collected, being able to stay levelheaded and focused even during the most stressful situations.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Costume</h2>
		<p>Her hero costume consists of a bright green turtleneck bodysuit, tan-coloured gloves with large buckles on each wrist, and two matching belts - one across her breasts with a strap around each shoulder and one around her waist. She also wears tight black boots, green webbed flippers resembling frogs' toes on her feet, and a tan-coloured headband and goggles with dark green-tinited lenses.</p>
		<h3>Winter Costume</h3>
		<p>For her winter costume, she wears a ring around her neck with two bubble-shaped objects just above her shoulders to regulate her body temperature. Her goggles has also changed, with a newly fitted visor so she can wear them more comfortably.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Asui's Quirk, Frog, gives her a frog's physiology and allows her to do anything a frog can do. This includes enhanced swimming abilites, hopping long distances, extending her tongue up to 20m, sticking to walls, ejecting/washing her stomach, camouflaging herself and secreting a mild, itch-inducing toxin.</p>
		<p>The drawback to her Quirk is when she is exposed to cold temperatures for too long, she goes into hibernation and is unable to function.</p>
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Asui's fighting style consists of Melee and Support Combat. Thanks to her Quirk, she is proficent in both close and long-range combat. She employs a fighting style that involves a great amount of agility and powerful leaps to evade, surprise, and confuse her oppoents, as well as using her increased leg strength to deliver powerful kicks. She also uses her elongated tongue in a grappling or whip-like fashion to subdue her opponents.</p>
