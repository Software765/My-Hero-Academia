		<p>Mina Ashido, also known as Pinky, is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Mina is of medium height, possible a little more broader than some of her other female classmates. She has short, fluffy, pink hair, two thin, hooked pale yellow horns protruding from her head and bright yellow eyes with the sclera being black. Her skin is a light shade of pink due to her quirk. When attending U.A., she wears the standard female U.A. uniform.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>Her hero costume consists of a purple and turquoise skintight bodysuit in a camourflage pattern, ending just above her breasts. She also wears a cropped, sleeveless tan-coloured waistcoat with white fur collar, a plain white eye mask and plum violet and beige acid-proof boots with holes in the soles, allowing her to secrete acid from her feet to use to slide around.</p>
		<p>For her winter costume, she wears a slightly longer waistcoat, with the sleeves reaching to her elbows. The fur lining on her collar is also thicker and wider, reaching her chin and is joined in the centre by two clasps.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Mina's Quirk is called Acid. It allows her to produce a corrosive liquid from body. She can also control the solubility and viscosity of it.</p>
		<p>The drawback of her Quirk is that there is a limit to how long she can produce that corrosive liquid until her skin gradually loses its natural resistance to it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Mina was born in the Chiba Prefecture. She has a cheerful, easygoing personality, who loves to hang out with her friends, espeically the girls of her class. Many people say that this personality is ideal for the best heroes out there.</p>
		<p>She loves to dance and eat okra and natto.</p>
