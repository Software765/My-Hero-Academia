		<p>Hanta Sero, also known as The Taping Hero: Cellophane, is a student in Class 1-A at UA High School. He has a very friendly and sociable personality. He is also quite humorous, loud and showy at times with his Quirk. But when push comes to shove, he is a brave hero-in-training.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Costume</h2>
		<p>Sero's hero costume consists of a plain black, skin-tight bodysuit with a turtleneck, which also has a white design on his mid-torso. He wears white boots, white short bands around his waist, the sides of his thighs and larger ones across his chest, shoulder pads that are shaped like tape dispensers and a yellow helmet with a large black visor obscuring his face.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Sero's Quirk, Tape, gives gim tape dispenser-like organs in his elbows, from which he can shoot long cellophane tape-like strips, that seem to be sturdier than regular tape.</p>
		<p>He can use his tape to wrap people, swing long distances and create traps.</p>
		<p>The main drawback to his Quirk is that his skin can dry out when he overuses it. Through intense training, he has increased his capacity and improved his tape's textile strength ans shooting speed.</p>
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Sero's fighting style consists of Long-ranged and Support Combat. He primarily uses his tape to bind targets from afar, restraining them from action by knotting his tape around their bodies. He prefers to remain at a safe distance while firing large amounts of tape at his opponents with impressive accuracy.</p>
