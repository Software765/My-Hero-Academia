	<div class="info">
		<p>Shoto Todoroki, also known as Shoto, is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School, where he got in through offical recommendations. He is one of the main protagonists in the My Hero Academia anime.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Shoto is reasonably tall with a rather muscular build. He has long, neck-length hair that is split evenly in colour - white on his right and crimson red on his left. He also has heterochromia iridium, with his left eye being turquoise and his right a brownish dark grey, and a large burn scar on the left side of his face. When attending U.A., he wears the standard male U.A. uniform, only replacing the usual brown shoes with casual pale cyan lace-ups.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>His initial hero costume consisted of a plain off-white shirt with matching trousers and boots. He also has what appears to be a material resembling ice that covers his entire left side.</p>
		<p>When he went to his intership, his costume change, now consisting of a dark blue jacket with a high collar that is joined with a grey neckpiece. He also wears baggy trousers of the same colour, a metal-plated combat vest and white boots.</p>
		<p>For the Provisional License Exam, he upgrades, adding two burgundy wrist gurads with metal plating to help regulate the temperature of his body after his attacks. His boots also upgrades, now sporting a set of straps.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Shoto's quirk is called Half-Cold Half-Hot. It gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and generate fire from his left.</p>  
		<p>Before, he had favoured using his ice powers rather than fire, only accepting it after the Sports Festival. This, however, causes him to have some difficulty controlling it.</p>
		<p>A drawback to his Quirk is that if he overuses one element without utilising the other, his own body temperature will suffer - the ice half causes him frostbite and the fire half causes heatstroke. He also has trouble using both elements at the same time, but through intense training, he learns how to do so.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Shoto was born near the Shizuoka prefecture and lived with his father, Enji Todoroki, also known as the No.2 Hero Endenvour, and his older sister, Fuyummi Todoroki. He has two brothers, Natuso, who doesn't live in the house and Touya, whose whereabouts are unknown. He also has a mother, Rei Todoroki, who lives at a hospital.</p>
		<p>He had a rough childhood as Endenvor trained him harsh at a young age and his mother burned his face, sending her to the hospital. This, when he first attends U.A., gave him a cold and unemotional attitude towards others and having a massive grudge towards his father. However, after the Sports Festival, he becomes more sociable and kind to others.</p>
		<p>He loves to eat Zaru Soba (Cold Soba).</p>
