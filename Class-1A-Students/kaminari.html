		<p>Denki Kaminari, also known as Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt, is a student in Class 1-A at UA High School. He has a friendly, social, and energetic personailty who likes to hang out with people. Though he is very academically bright and can become easily distraught during hero-work, he has shown to be confident when it counts.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Costume</h2>
		<h3>First Design</h3>
		<p>His hero costume consisted of a plain white shirt, under an open black jacket with a white lightning pattern, and matching trousers with two lines running down the legs. He also had a single, square-shaped earphone with a radio antenna over his right ear.</p>
		<h3>Second Design</h3>
		<p>For his Provisional Hero License Exam, he changes his costume to a slightly shorter black jacket with fewer white patterns and a yellow-rimmed lightning across each shoudler. He also has the same black trousers with small zig-zags near each cuffs, a white belt and white v-neck shirt. Around his right wrist, he wears a wristband with a circular mechanism from which he can shoot disc-shpaed Pointers which aids him in aiming with his Quirk. Addtionally, he wears a headset with a blue-tinted visor.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Kaminari's Quirk, Electrification, allows him to generate electricity and covers his body in it.</p>
		<p>The main drawback to his Quirk is that his brain can short-circuit when he exceeds his wattage limit, leaving him in a vulnerable state for 1 hour. In addition, when he emits electricity over a distance, he has little to no control over it. Though intense training, he increases the amount of electricity he can handle.</p>
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Kaminari's fighting style consists of Melee and Support Combat. Using his Quirk, he gains a defense mechanism that shocks anyone who comes into contact with him, leaving him slightly, if not completely, paralysed. As a result, he can be fairly difficult individual to face in battle, especially those that rely on close-quarters combat.</p>
