			<h1>School Activites</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Entrance Exam</h2>
				<p>The UA Entrance Exam is a test that is given to middle school students to determine their acceptance into UA High School. They take place in Feburary/March and consists of two parts, a written test and a practical test.</p>
				<p>The practical exam is the important test, where candidates partake in mock battles within replica urban settings. They are given 10 minutes to use their Quirks to immobilise robotic villains, in order to score points. The more points a student earns, the higher their chance is to get accepted into UA.</p>
				<p>What the students don't know is that they are also rewarded rescue points for heroic acts. Once the exam is complete, the students find out the resultls a week later.</p>
			</div>
			<div>			
				<h2>Battle Trial</h2>
				<p>For their first Foundation Hero Studies class, this year's Class 1A participlates in a Battle Trial, a combat training exercise.</p>
				<p>The students are paired up by drawing lots and then split into teams of heroes and villains. The trial replicates a situation where the villains are hiding a payload inside the building and the heroes must secure it or defeat the villains within a time limit. For the villains to win, they must either successfully protect the payload or capture the heroes.</p>
				<p>For each mock battle, the rest of the class watches in a monitoring room and afterwards, the battles are critiqued by the teacher and the students.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Sports Festival</h2>
				<p>The UA Sports Festival is an annual event held in the school where students from all grades and courses have the opportunity to showcase their abilities in different competitions, in order to be scouted by Pro Heroes and support agencies.</p>
				<p>For Hero students, it is a chance to show their worth in front of Pro Heroes, who might want to hire them after graduation. For General students, it is a chance to be transferred into the Hero course. Though Support and Business students participates, they use the festival for other purposes, such as showing off their inventions and honing their business skills.</p>
				<p>The events begins with preliminary elemination rounds, where those who pass move up to compete in the main event. Once the event concludes, Pro Heroes from any agency can nominate the students that earned their attention, as an expression of interest in their future potential.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Hero Agency Internship</h2>
				<p>Hero Agency Internships is a prgraam that allows UA students to enroll in internships with Pro Hero Agencies.</p>
				<p>To begin with, Pro Heroes can offer students that impressed them during the Sports Festival a chance to intern with them through a draft. Those students choose an agency based on that list. Students who didn't receive any nominations will choose from a list of 40 agencies, each specialising in a different aspect of heroism.</p>
				<p>Students have two days to choose their desired hero agency and then their internships will last for one week. Before their internship, all students have to choose a codename/hero name.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>First Term Final Exam</h2>
				<p>The First Term Final Exam is a mandatory exam taken by UA's Hero Department students at the end of the first semester. There are two parts to the exam - written and practical. The written exams take place for three days, whilst the practical exam takes place in a day.</p>
				<p> For this year's exam, the students are assigned to teams of two and must work together to fight one of their teachers, who are handicapped with weights. They have 30 minutes to either capture the villain or successfully escape from the battle to pass.</p>
				<p>The students are purposely matched up with their partners against teachers with advantages. Each student must learn to confront their weaknesses in order to pass, and the teacher's job is to exploit that. They are evaluated indivdually and any who fail are told they can't go camping.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Quirk Training Camp</h2>
				<p>The Quirk Training Camp is a specialised training program for the hero classes over the summer break to develop their Quirks under the supervision of the Wild, Wild Pussycats and their homeroom teachers.</p>
				<p>Due to the growing threat of villain attacks, students are trained to defend themselves and become stronger, in order to acquire their Provisional Hero Licenses. Emitter types will work on raising their maximum limit, while Transformation and Mutant types will train the part of the their body related to their Quirk.</p>
				<p>After training, the students cook their own food and can relax in the hot springs, contasy of the Wild, Wild Pussycats' nature reserve. On some evenings, the classes participates in games, one such being a test of courage. One class goes into the forest and are tasked with scaring the other class, who are paired up and trying to retrieve their name tags in the middle of the route.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Provisional Hero License Exam</h2>
				<p>The Provisional Hero License Exam is a biannual test organised by the Hero Public Safety Commission that grants capable studentss who pass each of its phases a Provisional Hero License.The test is held twice a year during each June and September, and are held in three different locations across Japan all at the same time.</p>
				<p>Many hero academics enter their students, but they seperate classes among the different locations in order to avoid their students from fighting one another. Very few first years attempt getting their provisional licenses, but schools like UA accelerate teh process. The exams used to hold a 50% passing rate for participants, but due to recent events, it has been modified to less than 10%.</p>
				<p>The exams comes in two phases. The first initial phase requires examinees to place three targets on their body in any exposed area. They also receive a box with six orange balls. The target will light up if they're hit by a ball. Student must elimate three competitors to pass the first phase. In the second, final phase, ections of the arena are detonated and students are instructed to act as heroes and conduct rescue operations. The rescuees examine the students and reduce points for mistakes and lack of effciency. Everyone starts with 100 points and if they go below 50, they don't get their license. In addition, a simulation of a villain attack can occur, forcing the students to juggle between rescuing and fighting.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Hero Work-Studies</h2>
				<p>The Hero Work-Studies is a program that allows the UA students to be employed by Hero Offices throughout the school year. They are considered very important off-campus activites for the formation of future heroes, since they are necessary to obtain real experience. In addition, it helps the participants to improve their combat skills and the use of their Quirks.</p>
				<p>It is similar to the Internships, but the difference is the Work Studies are closer to a real hero expereince. Students are treated as Sidekicks, and in some cases, Pro Heroes instead of guests. They are allowed to use their Quirks in emergency situations and can be dispatched to disaster areas to aid the relief effort. They must work in their respective agencies for at least a month and they will be remunerated for their work.</p>
				<p>Any student of the hero's course can participate regardless of the year, provided they have obtained their provisional license. However, first years have a harder time since they still have a lot of classes, so they rack up lots of absences. Students must use their networking connections from the Sport Festival to secure their work-studies.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>School Festival</h2>
				<p>The UA School Festival is an annual event held in the school where studetns from all grades and courses can de-stress by participating in spectacles of different themes.</p>
				<p>There are exhibts, performances, spectacles, food stands, etc., with one of the best-knoown events being the Beauty Pageant. Not only is the festival organised for the students to blow off steam and have fun, it also offers the opportunity for many students to make themselves known, especially to those not in the hero course.</p>

			<h1>Uniforms</h1>
			<h2>School Uniform</h2>
			<p>The UA High School student uniform consists of a long-sleeve, button-up white shirt, a grey blazer with blue-green stripes, and a red tie. The boys uniform includes dark blue-green trousers, while the girls uniform includes a dark blue-green pleated skirt, and a small, golden button on their tie.</p>
			<p>Each department has a different orientation of buttons on the shoulders of the uniform blazer. The Hero Course has one on each shoulder, Support has two, General Studies has two with a gap between and Management has three. In addition, each departments has different orientation of stripes on the wrist of the blazers. Hero Course has two, Support has three, along wiht three on the blazer collor, Business also has three and General Studies has one.</p>
			<p>While the students are required to wear the uniform, it seems the faculty is lax about enforcing them to wear the outfit properly, such as having the top button undone, wearing the tie not properly or even not wearing it at all.</p>
			<h2>P.E. Uniform</h2>
			<p>The UA P.E. uniform consists of dark blue trousers with white vertical lines going up the legs and a dark blue short-sleeved shirt with white lines that form the letters 'U' and 'A'. The winter variation consists of a long-sleeved shirt with a higher collar.</p>
