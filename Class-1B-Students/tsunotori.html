		<p>Pony Tsunotori, also known as Rocketti, is a student in Class 1-B at UA High School. She has a timid, naive and innocent personality, as she doesn't have much knowledge of the language of Japan as a foreigner. Despite this, during combat, she is thoughtful and diligent, as she shows a sense of observant and determination.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Cosutme</h2>
		<p>Tusnotori's hero costume consists of an orange skin-tight shirt with paler markings around her chest and stomach, with matching-coloured trousers and a pair of fingerless gloves. She wears a horse halter around her head with a lead rope dangling from the back, belts secured around her collarbone, biceps, and lower torso, and boots that not only guard her hooves but also have stirrups attached on either side. Her entire outfit resembles a jockey and is horse-themed, matching her appearance and Quirk.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Tsunotori's Quirk, Horn Cannon, gives her a pair of horns on her head. She is able to launch her horns as projectiles and a new set will grow back almost immediately. She can also remotely control up to four of them at a time.</p> 
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Tsunotori's fighting style consists of Melee and Ranged Combat. She has a excellent handle on her Quirk, which is primarily emplyed for long-range combat due to its projectile nature. Because of their curved shape, her horns are ideal for piercing or pinning down enemies. They can also assit with mobility, as they're large and strong enough to transport her and others to various locations.</p>
