		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Shota's Quirk is called Erasure. It gives him the ability to nullify another person's Quirk by looking at the user. This Quirk, however, has no offensive potential.</p>
		<p>There are many drawbacks to this Quirk - It deactivates if Shota blinks or his line of sight is blocked, it gives him bad dry eye which forces him to blink more often when he uses the power continuously, Mutant-Class Quirks are immune to it and the Quirk causes his hair to stand on end, which allows his enemies to see if his Quirk is active or not.</p>
