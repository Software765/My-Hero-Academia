	<div class="intro">
		<p>Izuku Midoriya, also known as Deku, is the main protagonist in the My Hero Academia anime. He goes to U.A. High School, where he is a student at Class 1-A.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Izuku is quite short for his age, being about 2 inches below the average height for a 15/16 year old. He has short, messy dark-green hair, big green eyes and small freckles on each cheek. After the Sports Festival, his right hand becomes slightly deformed and has a couple of scars. After his fight with Muscular, his right arm becomes more scared, resulting in him wearing a black compressive sleeve on his upper right arm to support the heavy damage on it. When going to U.A., Izuku wears the offical uniform, though his tie is not done properly and along with that, he wears red, ankle boots.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>His hero costume has gone through a few changes. Originally, he wore a green jumpsuit with a red belt, elbow pads, knee pads and white gloves, along with his signature boots. He also wore a mask with long ear-like protrusions and a respirator with a makeshift smile that resembled his favourite hero All Might. This costume got extremely damaged from his fight with Kastuki Bakugo.</p>
		<p>After that, the costume change slightly to be more sturdier and combat-ready. The knee pads have extended to his legs and thighs, and his gloves are tinted beige in colour, along with blue strips. His respirator is now metal and diamond-shaped with eight holes. While he still has his mask, he doesn't wear it as much than before.</p>
		<p>While preparing for the Provisional Hero License Exam, he upgrages his costume again to suit his new fighting moves, Shoot Style. He adds iron soles to his red boots and arm braces.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>At the beginning of the anime, Izuku was quirkless, making him part of the 20% of the world's population that is born quirkless. Then, he manages to catch the attention of the No. 1 hero, All Might, who gives him the unique quirk of One for All. This quirk had been passed on from generation, starting from when quirks started to become a thing. It allows the user to stockpile massive amount of power, enhancing their physical abilities. When All Might gives this quirk to Izuku, he becomes the ninth holder of One for All.</p>
		<p>At first, Izuku didn't have control of One for All, always breaking his limps as he used 100% without control. But after training with Gran Torino, All Might's former mentor, during his week intership, he is able to control the qurik, using 5% of it. During his sceond fight with Bakugo, he increases from 5% to 8%. During his fight with Overhaul, he disovers he can use 20% for a short amount of time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Izuku was born near the Shizuoka Prefecture, and lived with his mother, Inko Midoriya. He has a father, Hisashi Midoriya, but he rarely mentions him, since apparently, he is working oversee and he barely knows him. During his time before U.A., he was bullied a lot due to his quirklessness and wanting to become a hero despite that. He is inspired by All Might, wanting to be the kind of hero that can protect and save others with a smile.</p>
		<p>Once he enters U.A., he becomes close friends with Ochako Uraraka and Tenya Iida. Katsuki Bakugo was his childhood friend, having known each other since they were little. They stopped being friends during their middle school days. with Bakugo contributing to the bullying, but after attending U.A. and other events, they are slowly learning to work together.</p>
		<p>Izuku enjoys writing down notes about pro heroes, his classmates and their wuirks in order to analyse them. His favourite food is Katsudon and despite having green hair, he is normally described as plain-looking.</p>
