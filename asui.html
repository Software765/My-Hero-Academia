		<p>Tsuyu Asui, also known as the Rainy Season Hero: Froppy, is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Tsuyu is short and of a relatively slender build compared to her classmates. Her appearance is rather frog-like, with a very wide mouth resembling a common frog. She has oval-shaped black eyes, long, dark sea-green hair that is tied at the bottom in a bow, and her hands are notable large. When attending U.A., she wears the standard female U.A. uniform.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>Her hero costume consists of a bright green turtleneck bodysuit, tan-coloured gloves with large buckles on each wrist, and two matching belts - one across her breasts with a strap around each shoulder and one around her waist. She also wears tight black boots, green webbed flippers resembling frogs' toes on her feet, a tan-coloured headband and goggles wih dark green-tinited lenses.</p>
		<p>For her winter costume, she wears a ring around her neck with two bubble-shaped objects just above shoulder, presumably to help with the regulation of her body temperature. Her goggles has also changed, being newly fitted with a visor so she can wear them more comfortably.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Tsuyu Quirk's is called Frog. It allows her to do anything a frog can do. This includes hopping long distances, extending her tongue, sticking to walls, ejecting/washing her stomach, secreting a mild, itch-inducing roxin and camouflaging herself.</p>
		<p>A drawback to her Quirk is that when she is exposed to cold temperatures for too long, she goes into hibernation and is unable to function.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Further Information</h2>
		<p>Tsuyu was born in the Aichi Prefecture and lived with her mother, Beru Asui and father, Ganma Asui. She also has younger brother, Samidare Asui and sister, Satsuki Asui, whom before going to U.A., she took care of a lot while her parents were working.</p>
		<p>She is straightforward and laid-back, being able to always speak directly from her mind and what she thinks about others. She also displays a calm and colleted manner, which makes her a great pillar of emotional support for her friends.</p>
		<p>She loves the rainy season and loves to eat jelly.</p>
