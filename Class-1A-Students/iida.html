		<p>Tenya Iida, also known as Ingenium, is a student and the class representative of Class 1-A at UA High School. He can look severe, unfriendly, and even intimidating at first glance. He tends to take things seriously, but he's actually earnest, intelligent and noble.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Costume</h2>
		<p>Iida's hero costume consists of a black one-piece suit with a high collar, over which he wears various pieces of pale silver-coloured armor, including a chest plate, a metal collar around his neck and upper arm, and metal vambraces that extend past his elbows. He also wear a helment that covers his entire face and silver knee-high boots. His armour is very lightweight as its main purpose is to cut down air resistace rather than to protect him.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Iida's Quirk, Engine, gives him car-like engines in each of his calves, giving him super speed and extreme kicking power.</p>
		<p>His Quirk requires that the exhaust pipes on the backs of his legs remain clear of obstructions in order to function properly. He also needs to fuel his engines by drinking orange juice.</p>
		<p>Through intense training, he has increased his leg strength and stamina, so he can run faster for longer periods of time. He also learns by removing the mufflers from his legs, he can grow new stronger ones.</p>
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Iida's fighting style consists of Melee Combat. Thanks to his Quirk, he has been revered as one of the fastest student in Class 1-A. He uses his increased speed to supplement his fighting style which involves powerful, high-speed kicks that can even crush metal.</p>
