	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Kyoka is petite with a slender build. She has short, dark purple hair that has a reflection resembling a sound wave and onyx eyes. She also has flexible, plug-like earphone jacks hanging from each of her earlobes. When going to U.A., she wears the offical U.A. uniform, sometimes wearing a waistcoat in place of the usual U.A. blazer.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>Her hero costume consists of a black leather jacket, long salmon-coloured shirt with several rips at the collar and hem and black pants and boots, which has stereos built into the shafts. She also has two small triangular red paint marks below her eyes, a plain black choker and white fingerless gloves.</p>
		<p>For the Provisional Hero License Exam, she upgrades her costume by gaining a set of headphones and two bracelets that double up as her amplifiers.</p>
		<p>Her winter costume is all the same, except her facepaint changes to two larger chevron-shaped marks.</p>

		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Kyoka's Quirk is called Earphone Jack. When her headphone jacks, that are hanging from her earlobes, are plugged into something, she can channel the sound of her heartbeat into it in the form of a violent vibration attack. She can also stretch her earlobes several meters. In addition, her Quirk allows her to hear minuscule sounds and vibrations from her surroundings.</p>
		<p>Through intense training, she increases the amount of sound she can hear.</p>
