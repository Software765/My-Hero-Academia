		<p>Ochako Uraraka, also known as Uravity, is a student in Class 1-A at UA High School. She has a very warm, lively personality who thinks about everything positively, though she is objective enough to see flaws and virtues. She is empathetic and friendly in general to people she meets. Despite those traits, she can take on an extremely determined, focused and somewhat intimidating attitude.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Hero Costume</h2>
		<h3>First Design</h3>
		<p>Uraraka's hero costume consists of a black skin-tight bodysuit with a pale pink design down the middle of her torso, along with two black circles on her chest and a thick choker around her neck. The accessories are designed to press her acupunture points. This consists of circular wrist guards, wide knee-high boots, a two-piece belt joined by a circle around her waist, and a helemt with a tinted visor.</p>
		<h3>Second Design</h3>
		<p>Her costume gets an upgrade during her Hero Work-Studies. The belt has been altered, her arm gauntlets changed, with the ability to shoot grappling hooks, and her visor no longer has a visor.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Uraraka's Quirk, Zero Gravity, allows her to nullify the effects of gravity on solid targets by touching them with the pads on her fingertips, causing them to become weightless and float. She can also cancel this effect by touching her finger pads together.</p>
		<p>Her Quirk is very good for restrainting opponents, rendering them unable to fight back. She can also gather wreakage, easily cleaing up disaster zones.</p>
		<p>The main drawback to her Quirk is that she can suffer from severe nausea when she execeeds her weight limit (around 3 tons) or makes herself float. Through intense training, she has reduced her resultant nausea and increased her weight limit. Additionally, she can float herself for short period of time without falling sick.</p>
		<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
		<p>Uraraka's fighting style consists of Melee and Support Combat. She shows a more preference towards rescue, in terms of heroism. In addition she interned with Gunhead, where she trained and developed Gunhead Martial Arts in order to attack at close range effectively, benefiting her Quirk in combat.</p>
