		<p>Eijiro Kirishima, also known as the Sturdy Hero: Red Riot, is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="info">
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>Eijiro is muscular and of average height. He has short, spiky hair, which was naturally black before he dyed it red for U.A., and red eyes with a small scar just above his right eye. When entering U.A., he wears the standard male U.A. uniform, only instead of wearing the usual brown shoes, he wears dark red trainers.</p>
		<h3>Hero Costume</h3>
		<p>His hero costume consists of two dark red, gear-shaped shoulder pads, a jagged sash joining from his left pad to the right of his belt, which has the letter 'R' in the centre. He also wears baggy black trousers with a half cape and black boots. He leaves his chest bare and wears a wired face guard.</p>
		<p>For the Provisional Hero License Exam, he upgrades his costume, now wearing black sleeves to prevent him hurting civilains with his Quirk during rescues.</p>

	<div class="info">
		<h2>Quirk</h2>
		<p>Eijiro's Quirk is called Hardening. It gives him the power to harden and sharpen any or all parts of his body, causing his flesh to become jagged and rock-like.</p>
		<p>A drawback to his Quirk is that there is a limit to how much damage his hardened skin can withstand, causing it to slowly dissipate and make him lose stamina. Through intense training, he is able to increase his strength and durability.</p>
